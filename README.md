The developed  <a href="https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/testbeds/secure-water-treatment-swat/">SWaT</a> Rebeca model includes the model of CPS components and CPS-related attack scenarios. By model checking we analyze security of the CPS design to recognize where the potential attack scenarios can successfully cause a failure in the system.
